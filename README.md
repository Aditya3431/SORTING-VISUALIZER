# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This project provides an interactive way to explore and understand various sorting algorithms through real-time visualizations. It aims to help users grasp how different sorting methods work and compare their performance.

## Features

- **Real-time Visualization**: Observe how sorting algorithms sort arrays with dynamic, animated visualizations.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes visualizations for a range of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust parameters like array size, element range, and animation speed.
- **Interactive Controls**: Control the sorting process with options to pause, resume, and step through the sorting stages.
